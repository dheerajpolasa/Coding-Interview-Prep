Given two binary search trees, merge the two given balanced BSTs into a balanced binary search tree.
Note: You just have to return the root of the balanced BST.

Give solution of O(m+n) time complexity.
Input format :
Line 1 :  Elements in level order form of first tree (separated by space)
(If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place)

Line 2: Elements in level order form of second tree (separated by space)
(If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place)
Output Format :
Print the inorder form of new BST
Sample Input 1:
2 1 3 -1 -1 -1 -1
4 -1 -1
Sample Output 1:
 1 2 3 4
